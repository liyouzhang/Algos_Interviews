X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: id, date, people

Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).

For example, the table stadium:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | date       | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
For the sample data above, the output is:

+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | date       | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Note:
Each day only have one row record, and the dates are increasing with id increasing.



> Liyou:
1. Use WINDOWS function LEAD - the following records
2. use WHERE to filter on the people
3. return the original record, and the following 2!

**I don't know how to return the following 2!**

SELECT id,date,people
FROM stadium
WHERE people >= 100 AND LEAD(people,1) >= 100 AND LEAD(people,2) >=100;


> try not use WINDOWNS function! 

1. SELF JOIN

SELECT *
FROM stadium s1 JOIN stadium s2 ON s1.id = s2.id -1 JOIN stadium s3 ON s1.id = s3.id-2
WHERE s1.people >= 100 And s2.people >= 100 AND s3.people >=100;

**how to return the rows in vertical?**

> Answer:

select distinct t1.*
from stadium t1, stadium t2, stadium t3
where t1.people >= 100 and t2.people >= 100 and t3.people >= 100
and
(
	  (t1.id - t2.id = 1 and t1.id - t3.id = 2 and t2.id - t3.id =1)  -- t1, t2, t3
    or
    (t2.id - t1.id = 1 and t2.id - t3.id = 2 and t1.id - t3.id =1) -- t2, t1, t3
    or
    (t3.id - t2.id = 1 and t2.id - t1.id =1 and t3.id - t1.id = 2) -- t3, t2, t1
)
order by t1.id
;
