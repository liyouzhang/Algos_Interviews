Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
Note:
No one would report to himself.

1. direct reports - ManagerID - group by the same 

|ManagerId| count of unique Id
2. >= 5
3. select the name


WITH Managers AS (
SELECT ManagerId, COUNT (DISTINCT Id)AS Direct_reports
FROM Employee
GROUP BY ManagerId
HAVING Direct_reports >= 5)

SELECT em.Name
FROM Employee em, Managers ma
WHERE em.Id = ma.ManagerId
